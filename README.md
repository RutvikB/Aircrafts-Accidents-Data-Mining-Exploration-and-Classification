# Aircrafts-Accidents-Data-Mining-Exploration-and-Classification

A comprehensive take on data mining, extraction and analysis of the <b>National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) Aircrafts Accidents Database.</b> <br>
Full Raw Dataset sourced from <b>official NTSB Website:</b> https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/index.aspx <br>

A <b>New (Customized) Target Label</b> is created by applying <b>statistics and two dimensionality reduction algorithms</b> namely : <br>
<b>1. Principal Component Analysis <br>
2. Restricted Boltzmann Machine Neural Network </b><br>

Both these methods are <b>unsupervised machine learning</b> methods, and are applied on a subset of the features available in NTSB dataset that can have the most impact on the accident severity. <br>

Data Cleaning and Pre-processing is performed using numpy and pandas. Data Visualization is achieved using MatPlotLib and Seaborn. <br>

Various <b>classical algorithms, ensemble methods and deep learning</b> algorithms are used for classification purposes. <br>

<b>Neural networks</b> are implemented with different <b>optimizers and activation functions</b>.
