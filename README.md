# Aircrafts-Accidents-Data-Mining-Exploration-and-Classification

A comprehensive take on data mining, extraction and analysis of the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) Aircrafts Accidents Database. <br>
Full Raw Dataset sourced from official NTSB Website: https://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/index.aspx <br>

A <b>New (Customized) Target Label</b> is created by applying statistics and two dimensionality reduction algorithms namely : <br>
1. Principal Component Analysis <br>
2. Restricted Boltzmann Machine Neural Network <br>

Both these methods are unsupervised machine learning methods, and are applied on a subset of the features available in NTSB dataset that can have the most impact on the accident severity. <br>

Data Cleaning and Pre-processing is performed using numpy and pandas. Data Visualization is achieved using MatPlotLib and Seaborn. <br>

Various classical algorithms, ensemble methods and deep learning algorithms are used for classification purposes. <br>

Neural networks are implemented with different optimizers and activation functions.
